# Hopfield Network project for BIO-210

 This project allows us to simulate the activity of a neural network using the principle that "neurons that fire together, wire together". To implement this we use Hebbian and Storkey learning rules.
 To have better insight on the project, see also "output" and "statistics and plots" files.
